<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>



<p>When a company is on the brink of administration, directors often wait too long to act. </p>



<p>By then, the bank or creditors have already moved, appointing their own administrator. </p>



<p>Directors lose control, their business is broken up, and they risk&nbsp;wrongful trading claims, misfeasance actions, or personal guarantees being enforced.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Without early intervention, directors are left exposed and powerless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>



<p>Emqore steps in&nbsp;pre-appointment&nbsp;to protect directors and preserve value. </p>



<p>We install a rescue-minded administrator from our coalition, giving directors influence over the process before it’s too late. </p>



<p>We provide legal firepower to shield directors personally while structuring survival strategies such as pre-pack sales, CVAs, or restructuring plans. </p>



<p>In short, we support directors, conserve the business, and stop hostile creditors from dictating the outcome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Result</strong></h2>



<p>With Emqore, directors and companies help shape their own insolvency, stay onside with creditors, and take back control of their cash-flows.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>



<p>Insolvency practitioners face two major challenges: </p>



<p>Winning appointments and maximising value once appointed. </p>



<p>Banks, or free charge-holders, dominate appointment pipelines, leaving many capable IPs struggling to access cases. </p>



<p>And when cases are secured, administrators often face resistance from creditors, fee scrutiny, complex litigation, and backfire from debtors that drains time and resources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Emqore is building the UK’s largest coalition of Insolvency Practitioners. </span></strong></p>



<p>We originate cases by reaching directors pre-appointment and pre-administration, positioning our panel members as the preferred administrators. </p>



<p>When appointed, you gain not only the mandate but also Emqore’s legal advisory to support complex administrations, from defending challenges to pursuing litigation and maximising recoveries. </p>



<p>Our model here is simple: you focus on independence and execution, we deliver origination and support.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Result</strong></h2>



<p>More appointments, stronger outcomes, and remuneration that is properly secured and defended.</p>



<p>Because our model is tied to origination and support, we only get paid after a successful recovery here.</p>

<p>Unsecured and minority creditors almost always lose out during insolvency:</p>



<p>The average recovery is just ~1.48 pence for every £1 owed.<br><br>In many liquidations, the median recovery is 0%. Nothing at all.<br><br>Administrators are appointed to act for all creditors, but without pressure, they may prioritise speed and simplicity over maximum recoveries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>



<p>When creditors unite, they can change outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>Emqore</strong> brings together dispersed creditors (small, unsecured, or minority) into blocs and forms committees of 3–5 members to give them a formal voice.</p>



<p>We run the committee with the legal firepower needed to hold administrators to account, and maximise debt recovery.</p>



<p>That means pursuing claims against directors, clawing back undervalued sales, and challenging unfair preferences to best support creditors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Result</strong></h2>



<p>The result is simple: better recoveries, such as turning a 2p/£ distribution into 5p/£ or more. </p>



<p>And because our fees are outcome-based, you pay us nothing upfront. When we deliver that uplift, we seek to attain remuneration from the debtors&#8217; estate.</p>
